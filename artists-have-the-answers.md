  headline: Artists Have The Answers?
  content: 'What happens when we bring the practices of artists and consultants into
    the same space? In late October 2021 we will convene a series of workshops in
    hybrid form (online + in Vienna) to explore this possibility: will it be a dance
    party or a hypocritical brawl? <br><br>As the influence of consultancy firms and
    their methods expands within spheres of public and policy, we ask what artists
    can critically adapt and appropriate from the consulting field’s frameworks, tools,
    and practices, and whether consultants can learn from the skillsets and practices
    of artists in their work. Our line of inquiry follows the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/mckinsey-ICE-immigration.html"><span

    style="text-decoration: underline;">consultancy capitalism</span></a>, is inspired
    by the questions left unanswered by the <a href="https://transversal.at/transversal/0102/fraser/en"><span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">Services project</span></a>, and is concerned
    with artists developing resilient practices amongst the changing rhetoric of the
    role of art in society and the evaluation of its “impact.” The workshops will
    create opportunities for discussion and dialogical analysis of practices, techniques,
    frameworks, motivations, performativity, and aesthetics.<br><br>After this first
    series of workshops, participants will be invited to develop concepts for performative
    works that will later be commissioned for a festival of interaction-based projects.
    Resultant projects and commissioned works may include (but are not limited to…)
    <br>* works that appropriate and interrogate the performativity of consultancy
    practices and question ideas of “resiliency,” “impact,” and “sustainability.”<br>*
    works based on interactions between individuals and “clients” — communities, institutions,
    companiesworks that take a critical perspective on the services and consultancy
    industries<br>* artworks that seek to influence the public sphere and public policy
    beyond the predetermination of cultural institutions and the market for social
    practice.<br><br>Some of the questions we will collectively consider are:<br>*
    what does consulting do in the world, and how does it do it?<br>* are you already
    a consultant? <br>* (when/where) what can consultants learn from artists, and
    how can they think about integrating artists'' practices, skill sets, perspectives
    into their consultancy projects?<br>* what can artists learn from consultants,
    and how can they adapt or appropriate tools, techniques and frameworks from consultant
    practices in their performative and interaction-based work?<br>* in the rhetoric
    of art contributing to society, and the ever growing bureaucratic lust for evaluating
    the impact of art and its public funding, what can we critically adopt from other
    client-relation and performative-knowledge practices?<br>* what happens when we
    adapt the methodologies of consultants to address the intransparency of the consultancy
    industries influence on public policy and to make work that seeks to influence
    the political and public spheres?<br>* is it appropriate or useful to describe
    some relations between artists and institutions “consultative” and resultant activities
    or projects as “consultancy”?<br><br><strong>Schedule (to be finalized in coordination
    with participants)</strong><br>29.–30.10. 11:00–18:00 Hybrid Workshop (Impact

    with the subject “Workshop”<br><br>The workshop is organized by Lukas Heistinger,
    Bernhard Garnicnig and Andrea Steves. <br><br>Bernhard Garnicnig and Lukas Heistingers
    work under the Artist Project Group label employs performative and collaborative
    forms of organization-building to interrogate phenomena of capitalism through
    curatorial and artistic methods. This results in works that do not resolve ambiguities,
    but make them aesthetically tangible in their complexity.<br><br>Andrea Steves
    is an artist, organizer, curator, and researcher currently based between Vienna
    and New York. She is a co-founder of Museum of Capitalism, an institution dedicated
    to educating this generation and future generations about the ideology, history,
    and legacy of capitalism, through exhibitions, research, publication, art, and
    a variety of public programming.<br><br><a href="https://artistprojectgroup.com"
